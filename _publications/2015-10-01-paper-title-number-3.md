title: "From Violence to Violence? The Long Term Effects of Conflict on Homicide Rates"
collection: research
permalink: /research/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
Abstract: 'This paper studies the long term impact of large scale temporary violence
in long term homicide rates. I analyze the case of Guatemalaâ€™s
civil war massacres and assemble data on their locations and homicides
between 2016-2019, to test whether there is association between the two.
I find that highly victimized municipalities have fewer homicides today.
Exploring precipitation variation as an instrument for massacres, I provide
evidence that such relation is causal. Generalized trust is also higher in
municipalities with more massacres, suggesting a mechanism connecting
past violence and present peace through increased local cohesion.'
