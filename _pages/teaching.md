<!-- I am an instructor of Principles of Microeconomics at the [Corpus Christi College](https://corpuschristi.ca/) and teaching assitant of Intermediate Microeconomics at the [University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/). In the past I have also taught Econometrics, Environmental Economics, and MA level Microeconomics 
-->

My [teaching philosophy](/files/teaching_statement2.pdf) emphasizes critical thinking and authonomy. I also strive to create an inviting and fun environment in my classes. While most of my teaching experience was with Microeconomics (at all levels), I have also taught Econometrics, Environmental Economics and Differential Calculus. Here is a [sample syllabus](/files/syllabus.pdf).
